## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- **Components**: Pure UI components with clear props interfaces
- **Hooks**: Business logic and state management
- **Utils**: Reusable functions and constants
- **Types**: Centralized type definitions

### 2. **Custom Hooks**

- `useCaptionInput`: Manages all form state and context data
- `useCaptionGeneration`: Handles caption generation and clipboard operations

### 3. **Reusable Components**

- Each major UI section is now a separate, reusable component
- Clear prop interfaces with TypeScript
- Consistent styling and behavior

### 4. **Better State Management**

- Centralized state updates through custom hooks
- Immutable state updates
- Clear separation between UI state and business logic

### 5. **Improved Maintainability**

- Smaller, focused files that are easier to understand and modify
- Clear naming conventions
- Consistent code organization

### 6. **Type Safety**

- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Proper type checking throughout the application
- Better IDE support and error catching

## Usage

The main page component now focuses solely on:

- Orchestrating the different components
- Handling high-level user interactions
- Managing the overall page layout

All complex logic has been extracted into custom hooks and utility functions, making the code more testable and maintainable.

## Benefits

1. **Easier Testing**: Each component and hook can be tested in isolation
2. **Better Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Improved Performance**: Better separation allows for more targeted optimizations
4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Clearer code structure and better TypeScript support
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to specific functionality are isolated to relevant files
