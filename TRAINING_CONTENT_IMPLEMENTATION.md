# Training Content Feature Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the "Add Training Content" feature for the Brand Voice page. Users can now add, view, and remove training captions that are stored in the database and used to train the AI on their unique writing style.

## Components Implemented

### 1. API Route: `/api/brand-voice/training`

**Location:** `app/api/brand-voice/training/route.ts`

- **GET**: Fetches all training samples for the authenticated user's voice profile

  - Returns samples with structured data (id, text, platform, date)
  - Handles cases where no voice profile exists

- **POST**: Adds new training samples

  - Accepts captions as a multiline string (one caption per line)
  - Creates voice profile if one doesn't exist
  - Appends new samples to existing ones (max 50 samples)
  - Returns count of added samples

- **DELETE**: Removes a training sample by index
  - Accepts index as query parameter
  - Validates index bounds
  - Updates voice profile with remaining samples

### 2. Custom Hook: `useTrainingSamples`

**Location:** `hooks/use-training-samples.ts`

- Fetches training samples on mount
- Provides `refreshSamples()` function to reload data after mutations
- Returns: samples, count, isLoading, error states
- Exported from `hooks/index.ts` for easy importing

### 3. Updated Hook: `useBrandVoiceActions`

**Location:** `hooks/use-brand-voice-actions.ts`

- **`handleAddCaptions`**: Now async, calls POST API endpoint

  - Shows success toast with caption count
  - Returns boolean for success/failure
  - Handles errors gracefully

- **`handleRemoveSample`**: Now async, calls DELETE API endpoint
  - Accepts index parameter
  - Shows success/error toasts
  - Returns boolean for success/failure

### 4. Updated Component: `TrainingTab`

**Location:** `components/brand-voice/TrainingTab.tsx`

- Added `trainingSamples` prop to receive real data
- Updated to display actual training samples from database (not mock data)
- Made `onAddCaptions` and `onRemoveSample` async
- Added loading states for add/remove operations
- Passes sample index (not id) to remove handler

### 5. Updated Page: Brand Voice

**Location:** `app/(dashboard)/brand-voice/page.tsx`

- Integrated `useTrainingSamples` hook
- Removed local `uploadedCaptions` state, now uses real count from hook
- Updated handlers to be async and refresh samples after mutations
- Passes `trainingSamples` to TrainingTab component

## Database Schema

The implementation uses the existing `VoiceProfile` model:

- `examples: String[]` - Array field that stores all training captions
- Each caption is stored as a string in the array
- Maximum of 50 samples enforced in API

## User Flow

1. **Adding Training Content:**

   - User pastes captions in textarea (one per line)
   - Clicks "Add Captions"
   - API validates and stores captions in voice profile
   - UI refreshes to show new samples
   - Toast notification confirms success

2. **Viewing Training Samples:**

   - Samples automatically loaded on page load
   - Displayed with platform, date, and character count
   - Shows sample number and preview text
   - Edit and delete actions on hover

3. **Removing Training Samples:**
   - User hovers over sample and clicks trash icon
   - API removes sample by index
   - UI refreshes to show updated list
   - Toast notification confirms removal

## Features

✅ **Database Integration**: All training content stored in PostgreSQL via Prisma
✅ **Real-time Updates**: UI automatically refreshes after add/remove operations
✅ **Authentication**: All API routes protected with Supabase auth
