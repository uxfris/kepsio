# Analyze Voice Feature Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the **Analyze Voice** feature that uses OpenAI to analyze writing style from training samples. The AI extracts key characteristics like tone, common phrases, emoji usage, and other voice patterns to help generate on-brand captions.

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ OpenAI Voice Analysis

**What It Does:**

- Analyzes all training samples in the user's voice profile
- Uses GPT-4o-mini to extract writing style characteristics
- Stores analysis results in the database
- Provides insights for generating on-brand content

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Style Analysis

The AI analyzes:

1. **Overall Tone** - Professional, casual, friendly, authoritative, playful, etc.
2. **Common Phrases** - Frequently used expressions and catchphrases
3. **Emoji Usage** - Patterns and frequency of emoji use
4. **Caption Length** - Average length and structure preferences
5. **Question Usage** - How often questions are used
6. **CTA Style** - Call-to-action patterns and language
7. **Key Themes** - Main topics and subject matter
8. **Sentence Structure** - Writing patterns and style
9. **Vocabulary Style** - Language level and word choice
10. **Unique Characteristics** - What makes this voice distinctive

## Technical Implementation

### 1. API Endpoint

**File:** `app/api/brand-voice/analyze/route.ts`

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/brand-voice/analyze`

**Authentication:** Required (Supabase)

**Flow:**

1. Verify user authentication
2. Fetch user's voice profile and training samples
3. Validate minimum samples (3 required)
4. Format samples for OpenAI analysis
5. Call OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with structured prompt
6. Parse JSON response with analysis insights
7. Store analysis in voice profile
8. Return success with analysis data

**Response Format:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "analysis": {
    "tone": "friendly and professional",
    "topPhrases": ["excited to share", "let me know", "drop a comment"],
    "emojiUsage": "Moderate, 2-3 per caption",
    "avgLength": "120-150 characters",
    "questionFrequency": "60% of captions",
    "ctaStyle": "Conversational and engaging",
    "keyThemes": ["entrepreneurship", "productivity", "motivation"],
    "sentenceStructure": "Short, punchy sentences",
    "vocabularyStyle": "Accessible and relatable",
    "uniqueCharacteristics": "Uses personal anecdotes and real experiences"
  },
  "message": "Voice analysis completed successfully"
}
```

### 2. OpenAI Configuration

**Model:** GPT-4o-mini (cost-effective and fast)

**Temperature:** 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)

**Response Format:** JSON object (structured output)

**System Prompt:**
The AI is instructed to act as an expert in analyzing writing styles and brand voices, focusing on social media captions.

**User Prompt:**
Provides all training samples and requests a structured JSON analysis with specific fields.

### 3. Updated Hook

**File:** `hooks/use-brand-voice-actions.ts`

**Function:** `handleAnalyze`

**Before:**

```typescript
// Simulated with setTimeout
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2500));
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Real API call
const response = await fetch("/api/brand-voice/analyze", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```

**Features:**

- ‚úÖ Calls real API endpoint
- ‚úÖ Error handling with specific messages
- ‚úÖ Success/error toast notifications
- ‚úÖ Returns analysis data

### 4. Database Storage

**Model:** VoiceProfile

**Field:** `style` (String)

**Storage Format:** JSON string containing analysis results

**Why Store It:**

- Reuse analysis for caption generation
- Track changes over time
- Avoid re-analyzing on every caption generation
- Faster caption generation (cached insights)

## User Flow

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Upload Training Samples**

   - User adds 3+ captions to training data
   - Samples are stored in database

2. **Click "Analyze Voice"**

   - Button appears when user has ‚â•3 samples
   - Loading state shows "Analyzing..."
   - Takes 3-5 seconds typically

3. **AI Analysis**

   - OpenAI GPT-4o-mini analyzes all samples
   - Extracts 10 key characteristics
   - Returns structured insights

4. **Store Results**

   - Analysis saved to voice profile
   - Available for future caption generation

5. **Success Notification**
   - Toast: "Voice Updated Successfully! üéâ"
   - User can now generate on-brand captions

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors

**Not Enough Samples:**

```json
{
  "error": "Not enough training samples",
  "message": "You need at least 3 training samples to analyze your voice."
}
```

- Status: 400
- User action: Upload more samples

**No Voice Profile:**

```json
{
  "error": "Voice profile not found"
}
```

- Status: 404
- User action: Complete onboarding

### API Errors

**OpenAI API Key Missing:**

```json
{
  "error": "OpenAI API configuration error"
}
```

- Status: 500
- Admin action: Set OPENAI_API_KEY in environment

**Network/API Failure:**

```json
{
  "error": "Failed to analyze voice"
}
```

- Status: 500
- User action: Retry analysis

### User Feedback

All errors show user-friendly toast notifications:

- ‚ùå **Title:** "Analysis Failed"
- ‚ùå **Description:** Specific error message
- üîÑ **Action:** User can retry
