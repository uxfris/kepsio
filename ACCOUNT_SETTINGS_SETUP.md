## Supabase Storage Setup

### Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** in the sidebar
3. Click **Create bucket**
4. Configure the bucket:
   - **Name**: `avatars`
   - **Public bucket**: âœ… (checked)
   - Click **Create bucket**

### Set Storage Policies

After creating the bucket, set up the following RLS policies:

#### Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatar

```sql
-- Allow users to upload to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

#### Policy 2: Allow authenticated users to update their own avatar

```sql
-- Allow users to update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

#### Policy 3: Allow authenticated users to delete their own avatar

```sql
-- Allow users to delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

#### Policy 4: Allow public read access to avatars

```sql
-- Allow anyone to view avatars (public bucket)
CREATE POLICY "Public avatar access"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```

### Quick Setup (Run in Supabase SQL Editor)

Copy and paste this SQL to set up everything at once:

```sql
-- Create the avatars bucket if it doesn't exist
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Allow users to upload their own avatar
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow users to update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow users to delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatar"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Public avatar access"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```
