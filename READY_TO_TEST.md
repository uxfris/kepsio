# âœ… Ready to Test: Generation-Based Tracking

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Complete!

The subscription system now tracks **generation requests** instead of individual captions, giving users much better UX.

## What Changed

| Metric              | Before      | After                         | Improvement           |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Free plan limit** | 10 captions | 10 generations (~50 captions) | **5x more output**    |
| **User attempts**   | 2 tries     | 10 tries                      | **5x more chances**   |
| **Mental model**    | Confusing   | Intuitive                     | Matches competitors   |
| **User anxiety**    | High        | Low                           | Can experiment freely |

## Current Database State

âœ… **Migration applied** - `generationBatchId` column added to captions table  
âœ… **Indexes created** - Fast querying for usage stats  
âœ… **Existing data** - 40 old captions (won't count toward limits)  
âœ… **Fresh start** - New generations tracked properly  
âœ… **Subscription active** - Your user has free plan (0/10 used)

## How to Test

### 1. Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Generation Counter

1. Go to `/generate`
2. Counter shows: **"10/10 free generations left"** âœ¨
3. Generate captions (add content and click generate)
4. Counter updates to: **"9/10 free generations left"** âœ…
5. Check sidebar ProBadge - should show: **"9 / 10 generations left"** âœ…

### 3. Test Limit Enforcement

After 10 generations:

- Counter: "0/10 free generations left"
- Paywall modal appears on next attempt
- Error message: "You've reached your generation limit"

### 4. Verify API Response

**Check usage**: `GET /api/user/usage`

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "captionsUsed": 0, // Counts generation requests
    "captionsLimit": 10, // 10 attempts allowed
    "resetDate": "2025-11-27T06:08:45.912Z"
  }
}
```

**After 1 generation**:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "captionsUsed": 1, // âœ… 1 generation (not 5!)
    "captionsLimit": 10,
    "resetDate": "2025-11-27T06:08:45.912Z"
  }
}
```

### 5. Check Database

```sql
-- See your generations
SELECT
  "generationBatchId",
  COUNT(*) as captions_in_batch,
  MIN("createdAt") as created_at
FROM captions
WHERE "userId" = '66576fe7-966b-493d-b644-f9008822a821'
  AND "generationBatchId" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "generationBatchId"
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Expected result:

- Each row = 1 generation
- `captions_in_batch` = 5 (or ~5)
- Each batch has unique ID like `gen_1730095234567_a9x2`

## Key Features

### âœ¨ Smart Tracking

- Unique ID assigned to each generation request
- All 5 captions share the same `generationBatchId`
- Usage counts distinct batch IDs, not individual captions

### ðŸ”„ Backwards Compatible

- Old captions (40 in DB) don't have `generationBatchId`
- They're excluded from usage counts (`NOT NULL` filter)
- Clean slate for new tracking system

### ðŸŽ¯ User-Friendly UI

- Clear messaging: "X generations left"
- Shows actual attempts remaining
- Pro badge matches generate page
- Unlimited shows "âˆž Unlimited generations"

## Updated Copy

### Generate Page Bottom

```
10/10 free generations left
9/10 free generations left
0/10 free generations left
You've reached your limit for this period
```

### Sidebar ProBadge

```
10 / 10 generations left
âˆž Unlimited generations (Pro/Enterprise)
```

### Plan Features

```
Free Plan:
- 10 generations per month (~50 captions)
- 5 variations per generation

Pro Plan:
- Unlimited generations
- 10 variations per generation
```

## Edge Cases Handled

âœ… **Old captions without batch ID** - Ignored in counts  
âœ… **Null batch IDs** - Filtered out  
âœ… **Concurrent generations** - Each gets unique ID  
âœ… **Failed generations** - No batch ID assigned, won't count  
âœ… **Partial saves** - All 5 captions have same batch ID

## Build Status

```
âœ… Prisma schema updated
âœ… Database migration applied
âœ… Prisma client regenerated
âœ… TypeScript compilation successful
âœ… Next.js build successful
âœ… All API routes working
âœ… UI components updated
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Counter shows "10/10 free generations left" on load
- [ ] Generate captions â†’ counter updates to "9/10"
- [ ] ProBadge shows same count
- [ ] `/api/user/usage` returns `captionsUsed: 1`
- [ ] Database has 1 row with generationBatchId in groupBy query
- [ ] Generate 10 times â†’ counter reaches 0/10
- [ ] 11th attempt shows paywall modal
- [ ] Paywall shows correct usage stats

## What's Next?

### Optional Improvements

1. **Adjust limits**: Consider 15 generations for free tier?
2. **Add variation button**: Generate more from same context (counts as new generation)
3. **Usage history**: Show past generations in a timeline
4. **Analytics**: Track which generation led to saved captions
5. **Stripe integration**: Connect payment for upgrades

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Set up Stripe webhooks (when ready for payments)
- [ ] Add email notifications at 80% usage
- [ ] Create admin panel to view/adjust limits
- [ ] Add generation history page
- [ ] Track conversion metrics (free â†’ paid)

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Check types
npx tsc --noEmit

# Build for production
npm run build

# Regenerate Prisma client (if schema changes)
npx prisma generate

# Create new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

# Check database
# Use Supabase dashboard or MCP tools
```

## Database Queries

```sql
-- Reset a user's usage (for testing)
DELETE FROM captions
WHERE "userId" = 'user-id'
AND "generationBatchId" IS NOT NULL;

-- Check user's current generations
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "generationBatchId") as generations_used
FROM captions
WHERE "userId" = 'user-id'
AND "generationBatchId" IS NOT NULL
AND "createdAt" >= (NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days');

-- See all generations with details
SELECT
  "generationBatchId",
  COUNT(*) as captions,
  MIN("createdAt") as when_generated,
  STRING_AGG(LEFT(content, 50), ' | ') as preview
FROM captions
WHERE "userId" = 'user-id'
AND "generationBatchId" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "generationBatchId"
ORDER BY when_generated DESC;
```

## ðŸš€ You're All Set!

The system is ready to test. The changes provide a **5x better experience** for free users while maintaining cost control. Start the dev server and try it out!

**Pro tip**: Test with a friend or create a second account to see the full flow from signup â†’ generation â†’ limit â†’ upgrade flow.
