## Why This Error Happened

The database schema was updated to add new fields (`platform`, `style`, `metadata`) but the migration wasn't applied to your Supabase database yet.

The SQL you just ran adds these fields so the caption generation can work properly.

---

## What Was Added

Your `captions` table now has:

| Field      | Type  | Purpose                                           |
| ---------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `platform` | TEXT  | Social media platform (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.) |
| `style`    | TEXT  | Caption style (Hook-first, Story-driven, etc.)    |
| `metadata` | JSONB | Additional data (length, engagement score, etc.)  |

---

## Verify It Worked

### Check Database (Optional)

1. Supabase Dashboard → **Table Editor** → **captions**
2. You should see the new columns: `platform`, `style`, `metadata`

### Check Generated Captions

After generating captions:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Table Editor** → **captions**
