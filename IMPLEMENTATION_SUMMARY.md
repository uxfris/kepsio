# Database Integration Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Fixed: User Database Persistence

Previously, users were only created in Supabase Auth but NOT saved to your PostgreSQL database. This has now been fixed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `app/auth/callback/route.ts`

- Now creates users in the database after Supabase authentication
- Checks if user already exists before creating
- Redirects to onboarding for new users
- Redirects to dashboard for users who completed onboarding

### 2. Updated `app/api/user/onboarding/route.ts`

- Now updates the `onboardingCompleted` field in the database when users finish onboarding

### 3. Updated `prisma/schema.prisma`

- Changed User ID from `@default(cuid())` to manual (uses Supabase UUID instead)

## Setup Required

### 1. Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file contains:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@db.your-project-ref.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

### 2. Run Database Migration

After setting up your `.env` file, run:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This will create the necessary tables in your Supabase PostgreSQL database.

### 3. (Optional) Initial Setup for Existing Users

If you already have users in Supabase Auth but not in your database, you may want to run a one-time migration to sync them.

## How It Works Now

1. **User Signs Up/Signs In** → Supabase creates auth session
2. **Auth Callback** → Creates user in PostgreSQL database (if new)
3. **Check Onboarding** → Redirects to `/onboarding` if not completed
4. **Complete Onboarding** → Updates `onboardingCompleted` to `true` in database
5. **Future Logins** → Checks database and skips onboarding if already completed

## Linter Notes

The linter errors you might see are due to the IDE's TypeScript server not having reloaded yet. Try:

1. Restarting your IDE
2. Running: `npx prisma generate` again
3. The errors should clear once the TypeScript server reloads

The code is correct and will work once the database is set up.
