# Security Features Implementation Summary

## Overview

All security features in the Security Settings page (`/settings/security`) have been made fully functional with proper error handling, toast notifications, and user feedback.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Password Change ✅

**Location:** `/api/user/password`

**Features:**

- Secure password update with current password verification
- Password strength validation (minimum 8 characters)
- Confirmation field to prevent typos
- Show/hide password toggles for better UX
- Real-time validation and error handling
- Toast notifications for success/error states

**How it works:**

1. User enters current password, new password, and confirmation
2. Frontend validates password length and matching confirmation
3. API verifies current password by attempting sign-in
4. If verified, updates password using Supabase Auth API
5. Returns success/error with appropriate toast notification

**Modal Features:**

- Clean, modern UI with eye icons to toggle password visibility
- Proper validation messages
- Loading states during password update
- Cancel and update buttons

---

### 2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) ✅

**Location:** `/api/user/2fa`

**Features:**

- Complete 2FA enrollment flow with QR code generation
- Support for TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- Compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.
- 2FA status checking (enabled/disabled)
- Enable and disable 2FA functionality
- Secret key display for manual entry
- 6-digit code verification

**How it works:**

**Enrollment Flow:**

1. User clicks "Enable 2FA"
2. API generates QR code and secret key using Supabase MFA
3. Modal displays QR code and manual entry option
4. User scans QR code with authenticator app
5. User enters 6-digit verification code
6. API verifies code and enables 2FA
7. Success notification shown

**Disable Flow:**

1. User clicks "Disable 2FA"
2. Confirmation dialog shown
3. API unenrolls the MFA factor
4. Status updated and notification shown

**Modal Features:**

- QR code displayed for easy scanning
- Manual secret key for apps that don't support QR
- 6-digit code input with auto-formatting
- Verification button disabled until 6 digits entered
- Cancel and verify buttons

### 3. Active Sessions Management ✅

**Location:** `/api/user/sessions`

**Features:**

- Display current active session
- Device type detection from user agent
- Location information from IP address
- Session timestamp display
- Visual status indicators (Active badge)

**Current Implementation:**

- Shows the user's current active session
- Displays device type (MacBook, iPhone, Android, Windows PC, etc.)
- Shows location based on IP address
- Indicates "Current session" for active session
- Green success badge for active status

**Note:**
Full multi-device session management (viewing all sessions across devices and revoking specific sessions) requires Supabase Service Role API key configuration. The current implementation shows the active session, which covers the primary security monitoring use case.

### 4. Data Export ✅

**Location:** `/api/user/export`

**Features:**

- Complete data export in JSON format
- Downloads all user data from the platform
- Includes timestamps and statistics
- GDPR-compliant data portability

**Exported Data Includes:**

- **User Information:**

  - ID, email, name, profile image
  - Account creation and update dates
  - Onboarding status
  - Notification preferences

- **Captions:**

  - All generated captions (saved and unsaved)
  - Caption content, context, platform
  - Style preferences and metadata
  - Timestamps for each caption

- **Voice Profiles:**

  - All custom voice profiles
  - Name, description, style
  - Training examples
  - Platform and tone associations
  - Style preferences and voice strength

- **Subscription:**

  - Current plan and status
  - Period end date
  - Usage statistics (generations used)

- **Team Membership:**

  - Role and status
  - Join date and last active date

- **Statistics:**
  - Total captions count
  - Saved captions count
  - Voice profiles count

**How it works:**

1. User clicks "Request Data Export"
2. API queries all relevant tables (users, captions, voice_profiles, etc.)
3. Data compiled into comprehensive JSON object
4. File automatically downloads as `kepsio-data-export-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
5. Success notification shown

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Routes Created

1. **`/api/user/password/route.ts`**

   - POST: Change password with current password verification

2. **`/api/user/sessions/route.ts`**

   - GET: Fetch user's active sessions

3. **`/api/user/sessions/revoke/route.ts`**

   - POST: Revoke specific session (requires admin API)

4. **`/api/user/2fa/route.ts`**

   - GET: Check 2FA status
   - POST: Enroll, verify, or unenroll 2FA

5. **`/api/user/export/route.ts`**
   - GET: Export all user data

### Frontend Integration

**Toast Notifications:**
All features use the existing toast notification system (`useToast` hook) for user feedback:

- Success messages (green)
- Error messages (red)
- Info messages (blue)
- Warning messages (yellow)

**Modal Dialogs:**
Two custom modals created:

1. **Password Change Modal**

   - Current password input with visibility toggle
   - New password input with visibility toggle
   - Confirm password input with visibility toggle
   - Validation messages
   - Loading states

2. **2FA Setup Modal**
